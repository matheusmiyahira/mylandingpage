## LOGO and SVGs

To create animated logos and icons visit to [Shape Shifter](https://beta.shapeshifter.design/) webpage.

To convert my photos into SVG I had to use a free online converter. I found many on the internet and tried out picsvg.com, convertio.co, pngtosvg.com, however, for my case the best one was the svgcreator.com.

> Getting photos from my phone, I found out that my iPhone records photos in a .HEIC format, therefore I had to convert it to .jpg in thi web site. [https://convertio.co/pt/](https://convertio.co/pt/)
